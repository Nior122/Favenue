# Vercel Deployment Plan for CreatorHub

## Overview
This document outlines the steps needed to deploy CreatorHub to Vercel with GitHub integration, including photo upload capabilities and production-ready features.

## Current Architecture vs Production Needs

### What's Working (Keep):
✅ PostgreSQL database with Neon (already cloud-ready)
✅ React frontend with Vite
✅ Drizzle ORM with proper schema
✅ Tailwind CSS styling
✅ Admin panel functionality

### What Needs Changing for Vercel:

#### 1. Photo Upload System
**Current**: Direct URL references to external images
**Needed**: Cloud storage integration

**Recommended Solution: Cloudinary**
- Adult-content friendly
- Built-in image optimization
- CDN included
- Free tier: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth
- Easy upload widget integration

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Sign up for Cloudinary account
2. Add upload widget to admin panel
3. Store Cloudinary URLs in database
4. Add image transformation on-the-fly

#### 2. Authentication System
**Current**: Replit Auth (won't work on Vercel)
**Needed**: Standard OAuth provider

**Recommended Solution: NextAuth.js**
- Supports Google, GitHub, Discord OAuth
- Session management included
- Database session storage (compatible with current PostgreSQL)
- Admin role management

#### 3. Build Configuration
**Current**: Express server + Vite dev server
**Needed**: Vercel-optimized setup

**Required Changes**:
1. Separate API routes for Vercel serverless functions
2. Static site generation for frontend
3. Environment variable configuration
4. Vercel.json configuration file
