# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Problem
Vercel is serving raw JavaScript server code instead of the React frontend.

## Root Cause
The vercel.json configuration was incorrectly routing requests to the server file instead of serving the built React app.

## Solution Applied

1. **Updated vercel.json** - Fixed the build and routing configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "builds": [
       {
         "src": "package.json",
         "use": "@vercel/static-build",
         "config": {
           "buildCommand": "vite build",
           "outputDirectory": "dist/public"
         }
       },
       {
         "src": "server/index.ts",
         "use": "@vercel/node"
       }
     ],
     "routes": [
       {
         "src": "/api/(.*)",
         "dest": "/server/index.ts"
       },
       {
         "handle": "filesystem"
       },
       {
         "src": "/(.*)",
         "dest": "/index.html"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Verified Build Works** - Frontend builds successfully to `dist/public/`

3. **Next Steps for User**:
   - Push the updated vercel.json to GitHub
   - Redeploy on Vercel
   - The website should now show the React app instead of raw JavaScript

## Authentication Note
For production, Replit Auth won't work on Vercel. Users will need to implement NextAuth.js or similar authentication solution as discussed in the deployment plan.

## Files Built Successfully
✅ Frontend: dist/public/index.html + assets
✅ Server: dist/index.js (for API routes)
✅ Database: PostgreSQL (Neon) - ready for production
✅ Images: 68 images in bigtittygothegg profile - all URL-based
